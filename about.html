              <p>
                I'm Jordan, and I graduated from University of Washington with a Bachelor's degree in Meteorology. I love learning and problem solving, especially when it comes to building web apps.
              </p>
              <h2>First Exposure</h2>
							<p>
                My first exposure to coding was during my freshman at UW, where I took two Java classes. My favorite part about the courses was practicing many problems in order to study for exams, especially when they got challenging and started to involve Linked Lists and Binary Trees.
              </p>
              <p>
                3-4 years later, I took a Web Development class, while also working with MATLAB in my Applied Math (AMATH) classes. I wanted to have a career in Software Development when I realized that the Shooting method I learned in AMATH was very similar to the the Binary Search algorithm. 
              </p>
              <h2>Other Facts</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I grew up playing Mega Man and Sonic games. My first games were Mega Man X for the SNES and Sonic Adventure 2 for the Game Cube. I always have my SNES handy whenever I am itching to bust some Mavericks!
                  I currently play League of Legends, and used to play MapleStory and Puzzle Fighter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One of my hobbies is custom mechanical keyboards. Having a pleasant typing experience is an important value to me, and I encourage others to try it! I recently found my first vintage keyboard, a Monterey K104, at a recycled electronics store. 
                  I currently type on a Think 6.5 with Gateron Inks!
                </li>
                <li>
                  I am fluent in American Sign Language, since both of my parents are Deaf. I want to learn Vietnamese so I can talk with my other family members in another language!
                </li>
