									<h2>About Me</h2>	
								</header>
								<section>
									<p>I'm Jordan and I am a Full Stack Developer who loves to learn and problem solve, especially when it comes to building applications. 
										I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology and a Minor in Applied Mathematics.</p>
									
									<p>
										My first exposure to programming was during my freshman year at UW, where I took two Java classes. 
										My favorite part about programming was learning how to think and approach algorithm problems, 
										and eventually solving them. I spent many hours on <a href="https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/problem/list" target="_blank">Practice-It</a>
										studying Binary Trees and Linked Lists.
									</p>
									<p>
										A few years later, I took a Web Development class, while also working with MATLAB in my Applied Math (AMATH) classes. I decided to pursue a career 
										in Software Engineering when I realized that the Shooting method I learned in AMATH was nearly identical to the the Binary Search algorithm.
										I enrolled in Lambda School to learn full stack development and have loved every minute of it.
									</p>
									<!-- <h2>Other Facts</h2>	
									<ul>
										<li>
											I grew up playing Mega Man and Sonic games. My first games were Mega Man X for the SNES and Sonic Adventure 2 for the GameCube. I always have my SNES handy whenever I am itching to bust some Mavericks!
											I currently play League of Legends, and used to play MapleStory and Puzzle Fighter.
										</li>
										<li>
											One of my hobbies is custom mechanical keyboards. Having a pleasant typing experience is an important value to me, and I encourage others to try it! I recently found my first vintage keyboard, a Monterey K104, at a recycled electronics store. 
											I currently type on a Keycult No.1 with retooled Blacks!
										</li>
										<li>
											I am fluent in American Sign Language, since both of my parents are Deaf. I want to learn Vietnamese so I can talk with my other family members in another language and learn more about my heritage.
										</li>
